AngularJSExamples
=================

A repository for AngularJS coding examples I develop as I work with the framework. I'm trying to do either larger examples or more unusual things that you don't see everywhere else.

Example 1: Text updated on the fly in an SVG graphic via AngularJS.

Example 2: Swapping out the image within an SVG. Note that the image actually appears in the middle of multiple layers of drawing so it would take much more effort to achieve the same thing on the fly with other techniques.
